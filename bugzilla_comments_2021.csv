1696086,Adjust macos build documentation,15291496,mh+mozilla@glandium.org,2021-03-03T03:41:13Z,"Created attachment 9206543
Bug 1696086 - Adjust macos build documentation.

The current instructions tell to install brew, Xcode, and Mercurial,
then go on to use the bootstrap script.

However, the bootstrap script will take care of those three steps on its
own (except Mercurial, where it will only tell to run pip3 install
Mercurial, until future improvements just make it do it on its own).

On a fresh macOS install, though, python3 is not actually installed
(although the binary exists), but running a python3 command will launch
an installer. Warn about that."
1722478,Import the XUL documentation to in-tree,15501910,dtownsend@mozilla.com,2021-07-27T10:16:43Z,The XUL docs currently only exist at https://github.com/mdn/archived-content/tree/b7b6516b2b522533e8ba51cb944700ace7dace4d/files/en-us/archive/mozilla/xul which makes it pretty difficult to browse.

1728875,Move developer_guide/ documentation from MDN to tree,15553360,rob@robwu.nl,2021-09-02T19:38:43Z,"I wanted to look up the page that described the `dev-doc-needed` process, but was surprisingly not able to find it any more. It is at https://github.com/mdn/archived-content/blob/main/files/en-us/mozilla/developer_guide/getting_documentation_updated/index.html

There are many more articles under `developer_guide`: 
https://github.com/mdn/archived-content/tree/main/files/en-us/mozilla/developer_guide

Only a few of the entries are listed at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w5WIy_X4vbIWrxH4pC8geqWKgpinj31I9ePwvBcZ9vQ/edit

Although some of the `developer_guide` documentation has moved already, it seems that there haven't been a systematic evaluation of whether the articles under `developer_guide` should be kept or removed. Instead of waiting for people to discover missing documentation (e.g. as happened in bug 1727117), please list all entries and check if they need to be migrated."

The finished installers will be in ``$OBJDIR/dist/install/sea/``. You have to have a build of the application already done before that will work, but `artifact builds <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Artifact_builds>`_ are supported, so that can save you a lot of time if you're only doing installer work.

devtools/docs/contributor/tests/debugging-intermittents.md:First, try running the test in isolation.  You can use the `--repeat` and `--run-until-failure` flags to `mach mochitest` to automate this a bit.  It's nice to do this sort of thing in headless mode (`--headless`) or in a VM (or using Xnest on Linux) to avoid locking up your machine.  Mozilla provides an [easy-to-use VM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Using_the_VM).

devtools/docs/contributor/tests/writing-tests.md:So when creating a new test, if this test needs to access the content page in any way, you can use [the message manager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/The_message_manager) to communicate with a script loaded in the content process to do things for you instead of accessing objects in the page directly.

devtools/docs/user/remote_debugging/debugging_firefox_desktop/index.rst:First, you'll need to ensure that both debugger and debuggee have the ""Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes"" and ""Enable remote debugging"" settings checked in the :ref:`Developer Tools Settings <tool-toolbox-settings>`. If you're using `Firefox Developer Edition <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Developer_Edition>`_, they are checked by default.

That is fine but I do not have access to change https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html so not sure this is the right component for this bug. We can update the wiki whenever we need to and always have BMO point to it rather than keeping the definitions in the BMO code. Who can we contact about updating firefox-source-docs?"

Hello Triage Owners and Release Managers,

tl;dr

This is a continuation of bringing consistency to Firefox bug triage processes and using them to help improve Firefox release quality. We’ll clarify expectations around Priority based on Severity and ensure triage queues don’t miss either field being unset.
The bugzilla changes for automatic setting of fields and bug bot nudges will start to take effect some time early/mid January so expect some more bugmail then.

**Same as before:**

* During triage, review the ‘bug type’ also and edit it, if needed. The current default type is ‘Defect’. Use [this](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html) as a guide.
* For bug type of defects, set bug severity as an indicator of ‘how bad is this issue for the user?’. Use [this](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html) as a guide.
* Anyone in the editbugs group has the ability to set the severity.

**New changes requiring action from you:**

* _Note: For bugs filed or reproduced by QA, the QA team will be setting the bug severity._
* Change your bug triage queries to check for an unset severity OR priority as the criteria. This is so that your triage does not miss bugs that have severity set by QA or another user from the editbugs group. You can add your component(s) to [this query](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?chfield=[Bug%20creation]&chfieldfrom=-4y&classification=Components&f1=priority&f2=bug_severity&j_top=OR&list_id=15485204&o1=equals&o2=equals&query_format=advanced&resolution=---&v1=--&v2=--) to get the untriaged bugs opened within the last 4 years (please edit the timeline as desired).
* Bugzilla will require a comment regarding rationale for any changes to bug severity.
* Mark the most severe issues as S1 in Bugzilla so they are accurately highlighted and get the right eyes on them.
* If you are a triage owner, please find assignees for all S1 bugs within 2 business days.

**Background and Details**

As you might remember from earlier this year, we made major changes to our definition of a ‘triaged’ bug to directly correspond to a severity being set. As part of this, we changed the default severity value from ‘Normal’ to ‘--’. This was done so we can use queries and filters on bug severity fields to identify and fix the most critical issues within the current release cycle, to maintain and improve our release quality.

When this change was proposed, we asked triage owners to modify their triage queries to search for bugs that had an empty severity field. However, in some cases, bugs are filed by QA who are in a good position to gauge the severity of the bug from a user’s perspective. Therefore, for QA-filed bugs, QA should be setting the bug severity, which can, if needed, be modified by the triage owner or bug assignee at a later time. Therefore, the triage owners should use severity-unset OR priority-unset as the triage criteria, [this query](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?chfield=[Bug%20creation]&chfieldfrom=-4y&classification=Components&f1=priority&f2=bug_severity&j_top=OR&list_id=15485204&o1=equals&o2=equals&query_format=advanced&resolution=---&v1=--&v2=--) can be used as the base for the desired component. We understand that this requires manual changes and is not the most convenient solution. In the future, we will try to provide automated triage query format and/or nag emails to ease this.

[Here](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html) are more details about severity levels and some examples of different severity level scenarios."

However, `bootstrap.py` already cleans up after itself:

    Clone complete.                                                          
    If you need to run the tooling bootstrapping again, then consider running './mach bootstrap' instead.                                              
    Unless you are going to have more local copies of Firefox source code, this 'bootstrap.py' file is no longer needed and can be deleted. Clean up the bootstrap.py file? (Y/n)

If `bootstrap.py` still exists, it’s because the user explicitly wanted it so. So I think this section of the documentation can simply be removed."

1802912,Document the reasons to maintain our own string classes over the std ones,16177971,nika@thelayzells.com,2022-11-28T19:04:41Z,"There are many different reasons why we have our own string types, many of which are historical, but also many which apply today. Here's a definitely-incomplete list of small things in no particular order:

* nsTString supports a literal string optimization, which allows them to store and pass around a literal string without copying it onto the heap. 
* nsTString has bindings to Rust, which allows us to use this type in FFI interfaces with our rust code, such as for XPCOM interfaces.
* nsTString uses reference-counted COW buffers to store the string data, which means that when a nsTString is copied, it does not need to copy the underlying string value, and can instead increment the underlying reference count.
  * This used to be especially important pre-c++11 as there were no move semantics, and copying a string buffer around would be very inefficient.
  * For modern code this may be less of a win, but could definitely be an issue if we were to do a naive conversion.
  * This also makes the implicit copy constructor less of a footgun.
* nsTString has an ""auto"" variant which can be passed around like a nsTString due to class semantics, but stores string data on the stack to prevent unnecessary copies.
  * Many std::string implementations also have a small string optimization, however it is generally much smaller than the nsTString type.
* A owned nsTString is safe to relocate in memory without invoking the move constructor.
* std::string provides no memory reporting functionality, and doesn't give the ability to control things like how the backing buffers are allocated. 
  * This means that we could not provide efficient conversions between nsTString and std::string types if we were to adopt it in more places, requiring full string copies at any boundaries.
* We have special optimizations in place to allow nsTString types to avoid copies in some cases when transferring strings into the JS engine or borrowing strings from the JS engine.
  * These depend on the ability to control things like the backing buffer, and probably wouldn't be possible to do with std::string.
* The bulk of our existing code already uses nsTString, meaning that sticking with it helps with consistency across the codebase.
* Support for wide strings (like nsString) is a bit spotty for the stdlib, and std::u16string was only added in c++11.
  * The std::wstring type uses `wchar_t`, which is only 16-bit-wide on Windows, and is a footgun on other platforms.
  * nsTString has special handling to enable it to work with wchar_t APIs on windows, while using char16_t on other platforms.
* Until c++17 added std::string_view, there was no standard type for holding a borrowed substring, meaning that APIs which wanted to take or pass strings had to pass around full std::string copies. nsTSubstring has always had support for being backed by a borrowed reference to part of another string.
* Due to ABI constraints, it is not possible for std::string to change to e.g. become more efficient.
  * Some companies (facebook comes to mind) replace std::string with their own API-compatible implementation for performance reasons (https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/docs/FBString.md). 

I'm sure I missed some other things worth noting.

We do have support for interfacing nsTString with the stdlib types in various places, for example you can convert a `const nsACString&` to a c++17 `std::string_view`, and I expect that over time we may increase our support for that, but I don't see std::string/std::string_view replacing nsTString completely any time soon."

At a high level, the trade-off between home-grown versus standard data structures is generally between flexibility and interoperability.

### Actual
Under [Perform a debug build of Gecko.](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/mobile/android/geckoview/contributor/native-debugging.html#perform-a-debug-build-of-gecko), in the #1 code snippet the second line `/android-ndk-` reference includes a hash `r17b`:

   ac_add_options --enable-debug
   ac_add_options --with-android-ndk=""<path>/.mozbuild/android-ndk-r17b""

```
### Expected
While the `r17b` may differ from the currently shipped NDK, i.e. to be `android-ndk-r21d`

Consider adding a note, to clarify which `objdir-android-opt` is expected to be used for the `Set up lldb to find your symbols` section to streamline debugging setup for less versed in the mozilla-unified codebase users. 

The section could be as follows:
```

--------------------------------

Edit your ``~/.lldbinit`` file (or create one if one does not already
exist) and add the following lines.

The first line tells LLDB to enable inline breakpoints - Android Studio
will need this if you want to use visual breakpoints.

The remaining lines tell LLDB where to go to find the symbols for
debugging.

.. code:: bash

   settings set target.inline-breakpoint-strategy always
   settings append target.exec-search-paths <PATH>/objdir-android-opt/toolkit/library/build
   settings append target.exec-search-paths <PATH>/objdir-android-opt/mozglue/build
   settings append target.exec-search-paths <PATH>/objdir-android-opt/security

The `objdir-android-opt` would be a platform-specific sub-directory from the project's main location, for instance, `obj-aarch64-apple-darwin21.6.0` in `mozilla-unified` could be used while on M1 macOS machine.

From my experience with bootstrapping (macOS M1 and Intel, Linux Fedora and Ubuntu VMs on macOS M1, Windows OS), clang and llvm were probably installed with a `./mach bootstrap` for everything but Linux (but M1 architecture is Tier 3 support, so that's ok). Rust had to be manually installed on Win and Linux VMs (which may not be the case for non-M1 architectures though)

Hi there :)
When I try to build with the `./mach build` command, It happens the build warning [attachment].
I checked the guide by the address of docs, and the Docs said, we need the `Python of version 3.6 or later`[0].
I think we need to update it to `3.7 version or later`.
We can't use the 3.6 version of python to build anymore.

1821781,[meta] Improve Firefox Contributor's Quick Reference document,16321011,tgiles@mozilla.com,2023-03-10T21:10:39Z,"Some things we have noticed during this Outreachy cycle:
- Contributors are confused about how to get started even when pointed at the existing set up documentation
  - This seems to be primarily because of network errors causing `hg clone` to fail or get into odd states. It seems like promoting the Mercurial Bundles document is a good idea.
  - There is also concern about the amount of time it takes to read and import all the changesets of mozilla-unified, so we should make a note that this part can take a very long time depending on machine specs.
 - I have also seen confusion about which option to select when running `./mach bootstrap`. We should list the reasons for each one and say something about ""most likely you will need the default option"".
- Contributors are not sure what the expectations are about messaging potential mentors and may ping folks unnecessarily
  - This is just expectation setting and varies from culture to culture, so laying down explicit guidelines would help get rid of ambiguity for all parties involved
- Contributors are not needinfo'ing mentors on bugs when they have questions
  - Unless mentors are actively watching bugmail for comment notifications, it is very easy to miss assignee comment. We should explicitly encourage the use of the needinfo feature of bugzilla.
  - We should also note that mentors should be actively watching their mentored bugs and set expectations accordingly. This way contributors know that they should get a response in `x` days or something, even if they didn't use the needinfo feature on their comment.
- Contributors are used to Git/GitHub and are unused of how to deal with Mercurial's mental model (or the fact that Firefox is not stored in a git repo)
  - While we have some documentation on this, [mconley's document on how he uses Mercurial for Mozilla code](https://mikeconley.github.io/documents/How_mconley_uses_Mercurial_for_Mozilla_code) seems to resonate well with folks and helps them understand what to do.
   - Should we be promoting `git-cinnabar` usage to these folks? They most likely have a git background to begin with and so this removes one more hurdle. However it adds one more hurdle, one more thing to install, one more README to understand to the process.
  - We should also be **very** explicit about creating one commit per bug (since most folks will be contributing to good-first-bugs that should be solvable within one small commit). Otherwise contributors are going to get into states they do not understand and will have to start using `hg rebase` and `hg histedit` on top of learning Mercurial in the first place. This is most likely (and understandably) overwhelming when trying to get a contribution in.
- Contributors are unsure of how to be assigned bugs to work on
  - Some mentors will require people to leave comments on the bug, while others are okay with anyone submitting patches without prior approval.
  - This will require discussion to help keep things fair in the long run, as both choices have pros and cons. Maybe there's a third (or fourth) better way to handle this situation.
- Contributors seem too quick to dig in and immediately solve the problem
  - It does feel like a bit of a mad dash of ""ask to work on bug, solve bug, move on to new bug"". We should probably have some wording about slowing down, asking questions, and seeking understanding of what the bug is asking for, how to solve the bug, how to verify the bug has been solved, etc.
- Contributors are asking to ask for help (instead of just asking for help)
   - Again, this is just expectation setting, but something we should clarify so that when people can help with available, instead of waiting around for someone to type up what issue they are running into.
- Contributors don't seem to be lurking or reading the scrollback of the rooms they are joining
  - This is most likely just another culture point, but we should make it clear that there are other people who are likely running into the same issues and asking the same questions. But also it should be worded in a way that doesn't actively disincentivize asking questions. Like it should be a ""do your due diligence"" kind of thing.
- Contributors are posting screenshots and not utilizing https://paste.mozilla.org
  - Maybe this is just a personal nit and so I could be persuaded either way, but many folks are posting screenshots (or photos of screenshots) which can be hard to read or missing context.
  - It seems like paste.mozilla.org is perfect for this logging situations but maybe having screenshots in the chat is better due to them being more permanent as opposed to a pastebin link.
- Contributors don't know where to find bugs in order to contribute
  - We have https://codetribute.mozilla.org and so we just need to promote this more.
- Contributors are concerned about errors that are not fatal errors
   - For example, there was a case of a Java extension in vscode becoming confused about some of the paths inside of mozilla-central.
   - Another case was a Glean error about setting a metrics feature or something
   - Another one was `Region.sys.mjs` failing to fetch a region.
- Contributors are confused about text editors that appear (vim, nano, etc)
   - Not sure what would be the best way to handle this, maybe just point at other helpful documentation for these editors?
- Contributors are confused on how to add commits and submit patches
   - We have documentation on these subjects, but we'll probably just need to add more details in this case
- Contributors are unsure of how to attach screenshots in comments on bugzilla
   - We just need to explain where to find this as it isn't clear until you've found the ""Attach New File"" button once
- Contributors on Windows are confused by ""warning: Watchman unavailable: ""watchman"" executable not in PATH ([WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified)""
   - We should specify that this is just a warning and can be safely ignored
- Contributors are unsure of what should happen when you run `./mach build` and `./mach run`
   - Maybe we should include a description of what happens as well as a screenshot of a local build running?
- Contributors do not know what meta bugs are
    - Probably just need a short section explaining what meta bugs are and how they aren't (typically) assigned directly
- Contributors do not know what the `clobber` command is and so are afraid to run it
    - Probably just need a short section explaining what `clobber` does and how it is a non-destructive operation but maybe increase build times if using full builds.
- Contributors are unsure of how to understand the Depends on/Blocks/dependency tree/graph section of a bug
    - Need a section explaining that a bug is most likely ready to be worked on if all the bugs it depends on are resolved/closed
    - I think we also need to call out the ""Open"" versus ""Closed"" status of bugs.
- (Outreachy specific) Contributors are unsure what is considered a contribution and how to record it
   - I think we can include this as part of the project descriptions we submit to Outreachy, like ""use phabricator links and bugzilla links to show work, bugs that have the Closed status are considered contributions"""

1822201,Expand tabbrowser documentation to include information on gBrowser,16324847,hjones@mozilla.com,2023-03-13T22:54:04Z,"The current `tabbrowser` documentation is pretty terse, and makes no mention of the relationship between `tabbrowser` and `gBrowser`. It would be valuable to expand on this, especially considering `gBrowser` is referenced [all over the place](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=gBrowser&path=browser%2F**%2F*&case=true&regexp=false) in Firefox front-end code. Given how frequently people probably come across or use `gBrowser`, it seems like it would be helpful/valuable to surface more meaningful search results when someone searches for `gBrowser` from within Firefox Source Docs.

Some ideas for information we could include:

* The fact that `gBrowser` is a window-global instance of `tabbrowser`
* `gBrowser` is primarily concerned with all things tab related - switching tabs, adding and removing tabs, etc.
  * Bonus points if we are able to document `gBrowser`'s responsibilities more comprehensively, but that seems daunting based on the code (all 6000+ lines of it). Even a pretty high level explanation would be useful
* Some `tabbrowser`, `gBrowser`, and `xul:browser` disambiguation - touch on how these are all related
* What's up with the name `gBrowser`? Where did that come from? What's in a name?

This is all covered by :mconley in [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRC7BSrQi88#t=25m32s) of The Joy of Coding. To start it would be enough just to get the information discussed there into source docs.

1. Comment here on the bug that you want to volunteer to help.
   This will tell others that you're working on the next steps.
2. [Download and build the Firefox source code](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/contribution_quickref.html)
   - [Here is a more detailed tutorial for getting set up to work on Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/index.html)
   * If you have any problems, please ask on [Element/Matrix](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#introduction:mozilla.org) in the `#introduction` channel. They're there to help you get started.
4. Start working on this bug.
   - First, run `./mach doc browser/docs`. This will install the necessary dependencies and build only the `browser` section of the docs (there are lot of unnecessary docs that will be built if you run just `./mach doc`!).
      - This operation may take a few minutes!
      - There may be a lot of red/error text about ""WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree"", you can ignore this for the most part.
   - After running `./mach docs browser/docs`, a browser should appear with the url being localhost:5500. This is the built documentation.
   - Create a new file called ""CodeReviewBestPractices.md"" under browser/docs/ and add [this Firefox Desktop Front end Code Review Best Practices document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11W-zo4eVNOtkjVfY86AkHBvybomOrtYWwHD3dxkGZwg/edit) to the newly created file and make sure it is formatted properly (including headings at the correct level).
   - You will also need to add ""CodeReviewBestPractices"" to the browser/docs/index.rst file to see your changes show up in the built documentation.
   * If you have any problems with this bug, please comment on this bug and set the needinfo flag for me.
5. Build your change with `mach doc` and verify your change by navigating to the newly created doc. Also check your changes for adherence to our style guidelines by using `mach lint`.
6. Submit the patch (including an automated test, if applicable) for review. Mark me as a reviewer so I'll get an email to come look at your code.
   * [How to Submit a Patch](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/how_to_submit_a_patch.html)
   * **This is when the bug will be assigned to you**.
7. After a series of reviews and changes to your patch, I'll push it to autoland.
   * If there are changes requested, [please read the ""To update a submitted patch"" section to ensure you don't accidentally create a duplicate revision!](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/contribution_quickref.html#to-update-a-submitted-patch)
   * Your code will soon be shipping to Firefox users worldwide!"

Google search isn't very useful in specific scenarios:

1. Google actively block VPN servers which can be considered to be an anti-privacy policy,
2. Google doesn't provide search services in some locations so using them explicitly excludes large groups of developers.

Please consider adding alternative search engines, eg Bing.

In the majority of cases this should be ""Firefox for Desktop Artifact Mode [default]"" and the current docs call this out, in slightly different ways, depending on which getting started doc you are looking at.

For example, the [quick reference doc](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/contribution_quickref.html#firefox-contributors-quick-reference) says: ""The default options are recommended. If you’re not planning to write C++ or Rust code, select Artifact Mode and follow the instructions at the end of the bootstrap for creating a mozconfig file."" while [the more detailed OS-specific docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html#choosing-a-build-type) say: ""If you aren’t modifying the Firefox backend, then select one of the Artifact Mode options. If you are building Firefox for Android, you should also see the GeckoView Contributor Guide.""

It would be nice if all of these said the same thing for consistency. I think having ""The default options are recommended"" in bold or something would be helpful to call out to folks reading it. I'm not sure which is more clear ""If you're not planning to write C++ or Rust code, select Artifact Mode"" or ""If you aren't modifying the Firefox backend, then select one of the Artifact Mode options"" but we should go with one or the other.

Also, there's no link to the [GeckoView Contributor Guide](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/mobile/android/geckoview/contributor/geckoview-quick-start.html) on any of these OS specific docs and so this needs to be fixed as well."

I have some minor issues with the Static Prefs section.

First, `StaticPrefList.yaml` [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/modules/libpref/init/StaticPrefList.yaml) contains more detailed documentation and that could be mentioned at the beginning.

Then
> Each mirror variable is [...] accessible via a getter function.

might include the functions name, e.g. as follows: *Each mirror variable is [...] accessible via a getter function. The getter function's base name is the same as the pref's name, but with '.' or '-' chars converted to '_'. Sometimes a suffix is added, e.g. `_AtStartup` for the mirror once kind.*

And third
> The mirror variable must have an atomic type if it is read off the main thread, and assertions ensure this.

does not seem to hold for the mirror once kind, as seen by the missing assertions in `StaticPrefListBegin.h`. Though `StaticPrefList.yaml` also states that mirror variables should be atomic when being accessed off the main thread. Maybe both places should be updated with atomic being only necessary for the mirror always kind.

I can get a patch ready soon."

is true for once prefs?

We discussed in [D178776](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D178776) if a once pref without an atomic type is the better choice for performance critical code.

This is true. There should be infrastructure ensuring once- prefs are also atomic, as they can be accessed at any time."

We don't really have a bugzilla user guide in the source docs, as far as I can tell, and I can't find any existing docs on when someone would use the ""Request information from"" checkbox. Maybe this is a new section in the quick ref guide called ""To request help on Bugzilla"" or something, and it can explain that if you want to make sure someone is aware of your request, you can use the ""Request information from"" checkbox and select the appropriate entry from the dropdown. Maybe we create a detailed companion document for this section, I'm not entirely sure. It doesn't seem like Bugzilla changes all that much, so maybe this is a low maintenance effort for the detailed companion doc...not sure.

To further clarify the intention of this bug, I want to make sure that new contributors (especially during the Outreachy contribution period) are queuing up their requests via bugzilla instead of leaving a comment, not knowing if anyone saw their comment, and then immediately reaching out via direct message on Matrix. This just doesn't scale well and prevents learning out in the open (which is something we should encourage in my opinion).

However, we should also have some section explaining (or linking) the big differences between Mercurial and Git. It's safe to assume new developers will have experience with Git and not Mercurial. 

Maybe this is part of this bug, maybe it's part of a different one but this section also seems like a good time to mention the ""one commit per bug"" rule of thumb for good-first-bugs. Happy to hear other opinions on this, but good-first-bugs should be solvable in one smaller commit and gives new contributors a chance to practice this pattern. It also helps prevent having to explain how `rebase` or `histedit` work on top of everything else a new contributor has to do to get a good-first-bug to land.

There's also some other questions that could be answered as part of this work:
- Should we be promoting `git-cinnabar` to new folks? More often than not `git-cinnabar` will allow these new contributors to leverage their Git knowledge instead of having to find the equivalent `hg` commands."

We should decide on how to deal with this as it's a difficult problem when the Outreachy contribution period starts. We don't want people hoarding bugs, but we also want people to have enough time to work on bugs before potentially re-assigning the bug. Not sure what ""fair"" looks like in this case, feels like there is no right answer.

Maybe determining the ""fair"" process can be a follow up to this and this bug can be as simple as ""add section that explains bugs are assigned when a patch is submitted to the bug"" for the sake of iteratively improving. Curious to hear other thoughts on this."

We get a lot of contributors who speed through bugs because they want to make sure they get some amount of contributions in before the period is over. However this means they'll avoid running tests, may introduce antipatterns, and generally not understand the problem they are trying to solve. I don't believe we want to encourage this hasty pattern in new contributors and so we should have a section about some common steps to take when working on a new section of code. This section should probably have some text like:
- Ask questions about the bug and your understanding of it
- How to solve the bug itself
- How to verify a solution fixes the bug
- other relevant pieces for this section."

For example we've seen the following cases:
- Java extension in vscode becoming confused due to paths inside of mozilla-central and throwing errors in the ""Problems"" section of the integrated terminal.
- Glean errors about setting metrics (which are non-fatal as far as I can tell)
- Exception in `Region.sys.mjs` because it failed to fetch a region, but otherwise did not cause a crash or anything
- On Windows, `warning: Watchman unavailable: ""watchman"" executable not in PATH ([WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified)`

Maybe this is too ambiguous to write an extensive section about, but I think there's value in having a section that says ""hey, sometimes you encounter errors that don't crash your build or browser, it happens and you can continue your work""."

To add a hook for linting in git, the following command is given
```
$ ln -s /path/to/gecko/tools/lint/hooks.py .git/hooks/pre-push
```
Maybe it is, as I wasn't familiar with `ln`, but I feel like `/path/to/gecko` is not clear enough.

Given `.git/hooks/pre-push` already assumes we are in the Mozilla repository, `/path/to/gecko/tools/lint/hooks.py` might be changed to `../../tools/lint/hooks.py`. And a note could tell the reader that `ln` will create a link with exactly `../../tools/lint/hooks.py` as content, i.e. the link is interpreted relative to its location, not to where the `ln` command was run."

I believe that would involve passing [the `-W` flag](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html#cmdoption-sphinx-build-W) to `sphinx-build`, which treats all warnings as errors. However, there would then be quite a few warnings/errors to work through before the build started succeeding again. :)"

--------

Now that your system is bootstrapped, you should be able to build!

.. code-block:: shell

    cd /path/to/where-you check-out-source-code
    hg up -C central
    ./mach build

default path is ``mozilla-unified``, but if you renamed it during ``python3 bootstrap.py``, please go to the folder you specific during bootstrap process.

🎉 Congratulations! You've built your own home-grown Firefox!

Now if you want to run your code on your own machine, please run:
.. code-block:: shell 
    ./mach run

If you are compiling this for another machine for the same platform, please run:
.. code-block:: shell 
    ./mach package
The output package should be in ``/path/to/where-you check-out-source-code/obj-*/dist/`` path, named ``firefox-*.*.tar.bz2``

If you want to compile for another machine for another platform, please see  `cross-compile instructions <https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/build/buildsystem/cross-compile.html>` before you run ``./mach build``

Steps to reproduce:

Error in title Can be triggered on projects such as https://app.element.io/

Firefox dev tools correctly shows the bundles and a webpack group in the source trees.

Clicking the bundles with minified code, the pretty print button is disabled and says it cannot be enabled with ""valid source maps"".

the source map in question is https://app.element.io/bundles/283aaa75466235a1b397/bundle.js.map

Navigating the Webpack group in the source tree shows all the files and node_modules, all correctly. But clicking on any file will just show:

```
Error while fetching an original source: unsupported protocol for sourcemap request webpack://element-web/node_modules/matrix-react-sdk/src/components/views/rooms/BasicMessageComposer.tsx
Source URL: webpack://element-web/node_modules/matrix-react-sdk/src/components/views/rooms/BasicMessageComposer.tsx
```

Also, to make matters worse, If right click the file in the source tree under the ""webpack"" group, and select the right source file locally, then the local file gets its content replace with the above quoted protocol error message!


Actual results:

cannot see mapped source nor prettified source.


Expected results:

I should be able to see either mapped source or prettified source. And Not have local files overridden with the error i was trying to override."

### Proposed addition (all the text below):

## How can I run accessibility tests (a11y-checks)?

The Tier 2 accessibility tests could be run locally with the `--enable-a11y-checks` flag:

```
./mach mochitest --enable-a11y-checks somePath/someTestFile.html
```

a11y-checks are only running on Linux 18.04 x64 WebRender (opt and Shippable) builds on remote, so when you'd like to run only a11y-checks on Try, you could query `a11y-checks linux !wayland !tsan !asan !ccov !debug !devedition` for all checks (i.e. with `./mach try fuzzy --full` command). Use `swr-a11y-checks` query to exclude devtools chrome tests from the set.

If you have questions on the results of a11y-checks and the ways to remediate it, reach out to the Accessibility team in [#accessibility room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#accessibility:mozilla.org)"

Actual results:

i read that this api is deprecated and is not recommended to use

neither hints why it is deprecated / what to use instead, nor links to any further info about the deprecation is available

googling about the deprecation of devtools api doesn't bring much info

unless you know related technologies well, it's difficult to understand what is this all about. and obviously one wouldn't want, in attempt to get that understanding, to invest time studying the documentation of the API that is marked as deprecated

deprecation warning ideally should explain what replaces the deprecated technology and should be studied and used instead, or at least provide a link to such information"

Quick and dirty script to look for broken links.

The `urls` in the script are found by searching for https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org with Searchfox ([Searchfox link](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Ffirefox-source-docs.mozilla.org%2F&path=&case=false&regexp=false)) and then extracting potential links via the devtools as follows:

`copy(Array.from(new Set(document.body.innerText.match(/https:\/\/firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org\/(?!,)[^ ""'`)>*\s{}]+/g))))`

What the script then does is to request all referenced URLs, and if there is a reference fragment present, also check whether the reference fragment appears in the generated documentation. Any missing link or fragment is printed.

This fuzzy approach works good enough. Some parts of the code construct the documentation links from substrings instead of having the link embedded at once, but I can easily resolve these cases manually."

- Under ""Why Triage"", we should mention the benefits of triaging bugs into good-first-bugs and good-next-bugs:
  - Helps manage backlog more effectively
  - Allows people who do not have mentorship experience an opportunity to gain that experience
  - Helps build understanding within a team (and within the larger organization) of what a ""good-first-bug"" is versus a ""good-next-bug"" versus a bug that doesn't fit into these categories
  - Allows contributors (both internal and external) to ramp up more easily by having small straightforward bugs (""good-first-bugs"") and then allow them to dig deeper on follow up bugs (""good-next-bugs"")
- Under some other section, or maybe ""Why Triage"", I don't have a strong opinion on the placement:
  - Document some heuristics on how to determine ""good-first-bug"" versus ""good-next-bug"" versus a bug that would not be a good mentored bug
    - If the bug involves adding documentation, it's probably a good first bug
    - If the bug is well-defined and is a P3/S5, it's probably a good first bug
    - If the bug involves a minor UI fix, especially if the changes are isolated to a place that isn't highly visible, it's probably a good first bug
    - If the bug is well-defined and is a P3/S3 that is a step above a good-first-bug, but not something the team is actively working on in the next 3-6 months, it's probably a good-next-bug
    - If the bug can be described as ""we would like to have this"", but doesn't have a firm due date, it's probably a good-next-bug (unless it's terribly complex!)
    - If a bug is a P5/S4 and appears to need a non-trivial fix, it might be a good-next-bug"

- We can add a link to the ""show what languages solving this bug will involve"" that points to https://github.com/mozilla-frontend-infra/codetribute/blob/4dc2e4f0425ce9d674e8a22b29db60465f6f19ff/src/utils/constants.js#L29-L43 which is source of the truth for getting bugs categorized correctly in codetribute.
- We can remove the bullet point of ""Add one of :code:`[good first bug]`"" 
- We can add another sentence of ""If this is a good next bug, be sure to add the `good-next-bug` keyword"" after the previous one dealing with `good-first-bug`."

Now that your system is ready, we can download the source code and have Firefox
automatically download the other dependencies it needs. The below command
will download a lot of data (years of Firefox history!) then guide you through
the interactive setup process.

.. code-block:: shell

    curl -L https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py -O
    python3 bootstrap.py --vcs=git

.. note::

    To use ``git``, you can grab the source code in ""git"" form by running the
    bootstrap script with the ``vcs`` parameter:

    .. code-block:: shell

         python3 bootstrap.py --vcs=git

    This uses `Git Cinnabar <https://github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar/>`_ under the hood.

    python3 bootstrap.py
.. note::

    When running ``bootstrap.py`` there will be a `UAC (User Account Control) prompt <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works>`_ for PowerShell after
    selecting the destination directory for the source code clone. This is

> 2. Paste this error to paste.mozilla.org in the text area and change the “Expire in one hour” option to “Expire in one week”. Note: it won’t take a week to get help but it’s better to have the snippet be around for a bit longer than expected.

I'm filing a single bug with the intention that it can be a single tracker and people can post phab patches to land straightforward swaps of documentation without filing individual bugs, which doesn't seem worth it in terms of the admin burden to get the docs updated - I'm setting `leave-open` to facilitate that.

1967098,The docs for building Windows don't include anything about cloning using mercurial,17495489,rizwansyed876@gmail.com,2025-05-17T20:57:15Z,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:138.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/138.0

Steps to reproduce:

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:138.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/138.0

As per the instructions (https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/contribution_quickref.html#firefox-contributors-quick-reference)[here] to setup Firefox on Windows, I first ran these commands without issue:
```bash
$ cd c:/
$ mkdir mozilla-source
$ cd mozilla-source
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/refs/heads/main/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py

$ python3 bootstrap.py
```

I then executed these commands in Powershell:

```bash
cd c:/mozilla-source/firefox
hg up -C central
./mach build
```



Actual results:

The output says that the bootstrapped Firefox system is not a mercurial repo:

```bash
PS C:\mozilla-source\firefox> hg up -C central
abort: no repository found in 'C:\mozilla-source\firefox' (.hg not found)
```


Expected results:

This command in the documentation should have worked seemlessly. It doesn't because prior to being told to execute this command there is no information about ensuring that the bootstrapped Firefox system is a mercurial repo."
